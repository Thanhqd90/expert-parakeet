## 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.

My proudest professional achievement was successfully launching an ROI calculator to our website for prospective customers to estimate their savings by switching to our software. Our business analyst provided me with what he wanted, and an excel spreadsheet with the formulas with the expected inputs/outputs and I was able to produce this within our CMS (Umbraco).

My proudest personal achievement was creating a website feature that allowed me to run tournaments for a video game I play more efficiently. Before covid, this web app was used worldwide and many tournament organizers around the world were able to use the feature I developed in order to improve the logistics of running their tournaments as the number of entrants grew.

## 2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)

Last year, being in touch with my own mental health became a priority. A book I recently read that allowed me to understand myself better is "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Dr. Robert Glover. While not all of the scenarios outlined in this book applied to me, I did have a serious case of "Nice guy syndrome" and was simply a yes man to everything throughout my life. This book has helped me create healthier relationships with the people in my life.
